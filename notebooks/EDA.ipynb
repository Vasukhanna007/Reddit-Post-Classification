      "was at a trampoline centre for my sisters birthday. we sat down to have a coffee after the session. i comment that the coffee was really hot and it could burn someone. the table next to mine was slightly sloped. a woman puts her baby in a high chair next to the table and the waiter puts the coffee down. since the table was sloped i saw the coffee tip and run off the table. woman leaps up to clean up the table. but the super hot coffee runs into the lap of the baby in the high chair. it starts screaming at it's scalding. the mum freaks out, not knowing what happened. i stand up and grab her baby and shout \"hot coffee on its lap\" and rip the soaked romper off. i hand the baby back to the mum, jog to the fridge and grab 3 bottles of cold water to pour over the babies lap. while the mum is holding the baby i pour each bottle after another. i tell the stunned staff to call 000 and report a burn with hot water. i tell another staff to bring me a cold wet towel. i could see the babies skin was red but it wasn't a bad burn. i loosely wrap the baby in the cold wet cloth (while the baby is still in the arms of its mum), by now the baby was making happy baby noises. i collect my things and walk out with my sister and friends. as i walked out the ambulance was pulling up. so yeah, saving babies. edit: as a teacher i must do a comprehensive first aid course every 3 years, cpr every year and epipen use every 6 months.\n",
